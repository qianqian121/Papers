### Motivation

In the last 10 years, 3D depth sensors such as LiDAR have proved to be very useful to perceive the environment in autonomous driving.

However few methods exist that directly use these 3D data for odometry.

This paper presents **a new low-drift SLAM algorithm** based **only** on **3D LiDAR data**.
